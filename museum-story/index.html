            <p><span class="all-caps">Green Springs</span> - Forty years ago, a group of men had the foresight to preserve artifacts and mementos from Green Springs’ illustrious history. They formed the Stemtown Historical Society and opened the Stemtown Historical Museum. According to the group’s current president, Tom Craig, people starting donating items the day after the museum opened.</p>
            <p>Carolyn Young, whose late husband Claude Young was one of the Stemtown Historical Society’s founders, said a love of local history spurred the decision to open a museum.</p>
            <p>“There was a group that just wanted to start a historical society,” Young said.</p>
            <p>The town’s quiet streets belie a prominent history. The town is home to the world’s largest natural sulfur spring, and, when weather conditions are right, its distinct sulfur smell greets visitors entering the town from the north. Although today the spring simply serves as a picturesque backdrop for events such as the town’s annual Green Springs Civil War Days, it once drew thousands of visitors from around the world.</p>
            <p>The spring’s known history began with the Seneca Native Americans, whose land once encompassed present-day Green Springs. When the American government forced the Seneca people from the land, Jacob Stem purchased the springs from the departing natives for 26 bags of grain and two mules. He then built a grain processing mill at the spring.</p>
            <p>“It never freezes. The water stays at 55 degrees year round, so Jacob Stem had an advantage over other mills in the area, because he could run the mill year round,” Craig said.</p>

            <p>Beginning in the 1860s, the sulfur water began to gain popularity for its supposed healing properties. A “water cure” building was constructed in 1868, and eventually an entire health resort was built around the spring. According to historical documents from Stemtown Historical Museum, wealthy visitors traveled to the resort not only for healing but also to enjoy “rowing, billiards, pool, croquet, lawn tennis bowling, riding and driving.” The water was bottled and sold to “cure almost everything” the documentation said.</p>
            <p>Among its sulfur spring artifacts, the Stemtown Museum displays original sulfur spring water glass bottles and the petite silken blue dress of Lotia Perin, who drowned in the spring at the age of 14 in 1904.</p>
            <p>The Stemtown Museum, which is packed with local artifacts, is housed in the former home of Allen Watrous, Green Springs’ only Revolutionary War veteran.</p>
            <p>“He had a tin-making business on one side, and the family lived on the other side,” Craig said.</p>
            <p>The museum boasts a school room where former students or their families often come to reminisce or research genealogy. The museum has a display of artifacts related to General James B. McPherson, who was the highest-ranking Ohio officer to die in the Civil War. The museum’s outside barn houses more items, including a horse-drawn hearse, locally found Seneca weapons and memorabilia from the once-famous Green Springs Band.</p>

            <p>Last week’s inclement weather forced the cancellation of a planned 40th anniversary celebration at the Stemtown Historical Museum, but the event was rescheduled for 7 p.m. Tuesday. The public is invited to attend the party, which will include complementary cake and root beer. The Stemtown Historical Museum is at 114 E. Morgan St.</p>
